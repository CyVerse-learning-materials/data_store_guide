**Data Store Guide**
====================

Goal
----

The Data Store is more than having a place to save your files. The Data Store
is a way to manage the life cycle of your data - from the moment you create
data, to publication, and beyond, there are a number of practices you want to
follow to ensure the integrity and value of your data are maintained. The Data
Store helps to maintain, share, and publish data without too much effort. This
guide will cover the minimum needed to get you started. Please look through the
`Data Store Manual <https://wiki.cyverse.org/wiki/display/DS/Using+the+Data+Store>`_
for a more comprehensive look at Data Store capabilities.

    * - Prerequisite
      - Preparation/Notes
      - Link/Download
    * - CyVerse account (optional)
      - CyVerse supports anonymous data access to public data sets in the
        `CyVerse Data Commons <http://datacommons.cyverse.org/>`_. This guide is
        written with the assumption you are a CyVerse account holder. See the

      - Cyberduck is a 3rd party application with a graphical user interface
        that allows you to easily upload and download data. (available for Mac
        /PC). You will also need to download our connection profile (bookmark).
      - - `Cyberduck <https://cyberduck.io/>`_ (Cyberduck website)
        - `Cyberduck connection profile <https://cyverse.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/241869843/CyVerseDataStore.cyberduckprofile?version=1&modificationDate=1568640173000&cacheVersion=1&api=v2>`_
    * - iCommands (optional)
      - iCommands are a set of command line binaries that can be used to
        interact with the Data Store. Download iCommands (available for Mac/
        Linux) if you want to use these functionalities.
      - - iCommands (`Mac <https://cyverse.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DS/pages/241869823/Setting+Up+iCommands#SettingUpiCommands-mac>`_)
        - iCommands (`Linux <https://irods.org/download/>`_ - **scroll down to iCommands CLI**)
    * - Spreadsheet editor (optional)
      - To edit a metadata template in .csv format, we recommend using a spreadsheet
        editor such as Microsoft Excel or LibreOffice Calc.
      - Free LibreOffice `Download <https://www.libreoffice.org/>`_

.. warning::
		When uploading your data to the Data Store you should not upload files/folders
		with names containing spaces (e.g. experiment one.fastq) or name that contain
		special characters (e.g. ~ ` ! @ # $ % ^ & * ( ) + = { } [ ] | \ : ; " ' <
		> , ? /). The Apps on the Discovery Environment and most command line apps
		will typically not tolerate these characters. For long file/folder names the
		use of underscores (e.g. experiment_one.fastq) is the recommended practice.
