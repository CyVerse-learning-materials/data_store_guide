**Drag-and-drop Data Transfer with Cyberduck**
----------------------------------------------

Cyberduck is a `free <https://cyberduck.io/license/>`_ 3rd party software tool
that allows you to drag-and-drop files between your local computer and the Data
Store. Cyberduck can also be used to rename files, and browse other shared or
public Data Store locations.

*Download and first-time configuration of Cyberduck*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  1. Download |cyberduck_link| for your operating system;
     follow the installation instructions.

     Double-click on the downloaded file - this should open the installed
     Cyberduck software.

  3. In the Cyberduck configuration window, enter your **CyVerse username** in
     the field 'iPlant username'.

  4. Under 'Advanced Options' ensure 'Transfer Files' option is set to

You should now be connected to the CyVerse Data Store and viewing the contents
of your home directory.

.. tip::
    At the top of your Cyberduck window you can see your location within the
    Data Store. From Cyberduck's 'Go' menu, you can select 'Go to folder' to
    navigate to any other Data Store location that is public or shared with you.

*Upload from local computer to Data Store using Cyberduck*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. warning::
   When uploading your data to the Data Store you should not upload files/folders
   with names containing spaces (e.g. experiment one.fastq) or name that contain
   special characters (e.g. ~ ` ! @ # $ % ^ & * ( ) + = { } [ ] | \ : ; " ' <
   > , ? /). The Apps on the Discovery Environment and most command line apps
   will typically not tolerate these characters. For long file/folder names the
   use of underscores (e.g. experiment_one.fastq) is the recommended practice.


1. Double-click on the Data Store Bookmark to connect to the Data Store
2. Select file(s)/folder(s) from your local machine and drag them into the
   Cyberduck window. (You may drag directly into an existing folder or from the
   Cyberduck 'File' menu, create a new folder).
3. A 'Transfers' window will appear. Monitor the upload to completion.

	#### Comment: Suggested style guide:
	1. Steps begin with a verb or preposition: Click on... OR Under the "Results Menu"
	2. Locations of files listed parenthetically, separated by carets, ultimate object in bold
	(Username > analyses > *output*)
	3. Buttons and/or keywords in bold: Click on **Apps** OR select **Arabidopsis**
	4. Primary menu titles in double quotes: Under "Input" choose...
	5. Secondary menu titles or headers in single quotes: For the 'Select Input' option choose...
	####

.. Tip::
    In the Cyberduck 'File' menu, there are several more functionalities. You
    can for example directly specify files and folders to move without
    dragging and dropping them. You can also 'synchronize' folders - only copying
    items that are missing in a folder rather than copying all contents.
